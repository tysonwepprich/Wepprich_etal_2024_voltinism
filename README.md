# Analysis for Wepprich *et al.* (2024) manuscript on Ohio butterfly voltinism

This repository shares data and code to reproduce our analysis of changes in butterfly voltinism based on 1996-2022 statewide monitoring organized by the [Ohio Lepidopterists](https://www.ohiolepidopterists.org/).

**In the *code* directory**, we include scripts to share data, reproduce the analysis, and produce manuscript figures.

**In the *data* directory**, we include raw data and intermediate products described with a metadata file. 

**In the *figures* directory**, we include figures used in the manuscript as well as two directories that contain plots from all species phenology (from generalized additive models) and generation classification (from mixture models).

**The *gams* directory** is empty as model results from generalized additive models were too large for inclusion.

**In the *species_model_coefficients* directory** are three files with results from the species models (not included in manuscript).
