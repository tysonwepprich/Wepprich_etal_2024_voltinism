This directory is empty in the repository because output files for generalized 
additive models is too large. Run 02_fit_gam.R to populate this directory. 
However, fitting GAMs is not necessary to reproduce the main analysis.

The plot directory is also empty, but would be where figures of species
phenological variation would be save if 03_plot_gam.R were run.
